# threejscheckers
this exercise follows the three.js tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZgkMS5rH3E
for more information please check it out

## Differences from tutorial
- Runs with LiveServer extension for VisualStudio Code
- Calls the CDN from the index.html and does the imports directly from the threejs website in the game.js file, I tried doing it like the video but it didnÂ´t work
- I made the model using blender but it didn't look like in the tutorial, I'm more interested in the raycaster from three.js so I'm leaving the model as it is
